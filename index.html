    <h2>Architect, Web Developer</h2>
        <img src="./assets/images/0201_7.jpg" height="200"/>
        <p>Studied Architecture - most closely Residential and Interior Design. Years of practical experience working with ArchiCad, 
        rendering softwares and Adobe Creative Cloud. Managing an eBay store for 2 years - researching, describing and taking 
        proffesional pictures of variable items. Worked as designer and CNC router operator at a small wristwatch company for 
        5+ years. For this I self-thought numerous softwares as ArtCam, MasterCam and other Cad-Cam programs. Currently studying 
        Web Development. I've developed an interest in the IT industry - as it's all around and will proceed to take bigger and 
        bigger part of everybody's lives. We learn more in real life situations than in class rooms and courses. That's why I'm 
        eager to start practicing my knowledge and learn new things everyday.
